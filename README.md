# 100 Days of Code



## Introduction

Welcome to the 100 Days of Code challenge! This GitHub repository is a documentation of my journey as I embark on a 100-day coding marathon. This challenge is all about dedicating time each day to improve my coding skills, work on personal projects, and learn new technologies.

## About the Challenge

The 100 Days of Code challenge is a self-improvement initiative designed to help developers of all levels boost their skills and consistency. Here's how it works:

- **Daily Commitment**: I commit to coding for at least one hour every day for the next 100 days. This commitment helps build a strong coding habit.

- **Public Accountability**: By sharing my progress on this GitHub repository, I'm holding myself accountable for my daily coding efforts. Others can follow along, offer support, or even join me in this challenge.

- **Learning and Growth**: During this challenge, I'll be focusing on enhancing my programming skills, working on personal projects, and exploring new technologies. Whether it's web development, machine learning, or something entirely different, I'm here to learn and grow.

## Goals

Throughout this 100-day journey, my main goals are:

1. **Skill Improvement**: To enhance my coding skills and proficiency in programming languages and frameworks.

2. **Project Development**: To work on and complete personal coding projects, building practical applications.

3. **Knowledge Expansion**: To explore new technologies, libraries, and tools, and share my learning experiences.

4. **Community Engagement**: To connect with fellow developers, share insights, and inspire others to take up the challenge.

## Project Structure

This repository is organized to make it easy for you to navigate my progress:

- **Daily Logs**: Each day, I'll create a new markdown file in the `logs` directory to document my activities, challenges, and progress.

- **Project Showcase**: In the `projects` directory, you'll find details about the coding projects I'm working on during the challenge.

- **Resources**: I'll maintain a list of resources, tutorials, and courses in the `resources` directory that have been particularly helpful during this journey.

## Join Me!
