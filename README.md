# JAVA + DSA

## Introduction

This GitHub repository is a documentation of my journey as I embark on a master DSA. This challenge is all about dedicating time each day to improve my coding skills, work on personal projects, and learn new technologies.

- **Learning and Growth**: I'll be focusing on enhancing my programming skills, working on personal projects, and exploring new technologies. Whether it's web development, machine learning, or something entirely different, I'm here to learn and grow.

## Goals

my main goals are:

1. **Skill Improvement**: To enhance my coding skills and proficiency in programming languages and frameworks.

2. **Project Development**: To work on and complete personal coding projects, building practical applications.

3. **Knowledge Expansion**: To explore new technologies, libraries, and tools, and share my learning experiences.

4. **Community Engagement**: To connect with fellow developers, share insights, and inspire others to take up the challenge.

## Project Structure

This repository is organized to make it easy for you to navigate my progress:

- **Project Showcase**: In the `projects` directory, you'll find details about the coding projects I'm working on during the challenge.

- **Resources**: I'll maintain a list of resources, tutorials, and courses in the `resources` directory that have been particularly helpful during this journey.
